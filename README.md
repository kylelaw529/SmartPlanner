# SmartPlanner

Project completed solely by me in the summer of 2022 for the Congressional App Challenge. This is a homework planner app created using Tkinter and thus, is only compatible on desktop. It includes features such as image-to-text AI to copy down homework quickly, daily text message reminders to do homework (the code for this does not work on GitHub because I did not share my private Twilio token and id, however, you can find a demonstration at https://youtu.be/6zSadrm9fB4?t=175), and all things you would expect any homework planner to do.
